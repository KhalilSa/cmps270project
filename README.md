# CONNECT FOUR WITH AI

## Project Description
This is a connect four terminal game made by four computer science students for an introductory C course. The game supports two modes Player vs Player and Player vs AI. For the AI, we're using a minimax algorithm which searches future possible moves (board states) to a certain depth and scores them using a heuristic function . As for the evaluation (heuristic) function, we're getting all different combinations of four windows in the board and depending on the player's and ai disks found we give a score to that position.
